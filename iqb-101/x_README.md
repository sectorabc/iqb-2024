Resources for the February 22 Crash Course at IQB Rutgers Python Scripting for BMB

The IQB Crash Course will run on February 22, 2022, from 1-5 PM, and will include four lessons, each with hands-on exercises and Q&A followup sessions. 

- Lesson 1: Introduction to Python and to Jupyter Notebooks
- Lesson 2: Reading and writing files
- Lesson 3: Processing multiple files
- Lesson 4: Visualizing structures in Jupyter notebooks

To participate in the IQB Crash Course, you will need to set up an account at chemcompute.org and follow these instructions to pull down the resources you need. 

## Need to add details here
 
- Lesson 1 Resources: no additional files or resources needed
- Lesson 2 and 3 Resources: PDB_files folder containing 1ddo.pdb, 3iva.pdb, 4eyr.pdb, 5veu.pdb, 7tim.pdb, 2pkr.pdb, 3vnd.pdb, 5eu9.pdb, 6zt7.pdb
- Lesson 4 Resources: @Jessica - They just use the PDB files in the PDB_files folder, but I think we should show them how to download files of interest to them.
